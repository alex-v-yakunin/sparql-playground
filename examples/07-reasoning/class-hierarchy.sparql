# Class Hierarchy (RDFS Reasoning)
#
# Demonstrate automatic type inference through rdfs:subClassOf.
#
# Expected result: 7 pairs (type, supertype) for each ADR
# Note: Each ADR is both :ADR and :ArchitecturalDecision
# Execution time: < 1 second

SELECT ?adr ?type
WHERE {
    ?adr a :ArchitecturalDecision ;    # Search for instances of parent class
         a ?type .                     # Get all types (including inferred)
}
ORDER BY ?adr ?type                    # Sort by ADR and type

# Explanation:
# RDFS class hierarchy (rdfs:subClassOf) enables automatic type inference.
# Ontology defines: :ADR rdfs:subClassOf :ArchitecturalDecision
# 
# The reasoner automatically infers:
#   if (?x rdf:type :ADR), then (?x rdf:type :ArchitecturalDecision)
# 
# Each ADR instance has multiple types:
# - Explicitly asserted: :ADR (in data)
# - Automatically inferred: :ArchitecturalDecision (via rdfs:subClassOf)
# 
# SQL equivalent requires triggers, materialized views, or complex normalization.
# Property Graph databases require duplicate labels or separate node types.
# RDFS reasoning provides declarative, schema-level class subsumption.
