# Incomplete ADRs (No System Binding)
#
# Find ADRs that don't specify which system they apply to.
#
# Expected result: 3 rows (ADR-006, ADR-007 twice)
# Note: ADR-007 appears twice due to two technologies (Kubernetes + Docker)
# Execution time: < 1 second

# Explanation:
# Demonstrates Open World Assumption - absence of data doesn't mean false.
# FILTER NOT EXISTS checks absence of :appliesTo pattern in any graph.
# In SQL: LEFT JOIN with NULL check.
# In Property Graph: checking absence of specific relationship type.
