# Hello World: First SPARQL Query
#
# Returns the first 10 triples from the database to explore its structure.
#
# Expected result: 10 triples (subject, predicate, object)
# Execution time: < 1 second

SELECT ?subject ?predicate ?object  # Select three variables
WHERE {
    ?subject ?predicate ?object .   # Pattern: any triple (s, p, o)
}
LIMIT 10                            # Limit result to 10 rows

# Explanation:
# Triple = (subject, predicate, object) - basic unit of data in RDF.
# This query is similar to "SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 10" in SQL, but in SPARQL 
# we work with a graph, not tables.
# Pattern "?subject ?predicate ?object" finds any triples in the graph.
