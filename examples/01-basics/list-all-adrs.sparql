SELECT ?adr ?label                  # Return ADR URI and its label
WHERE {
    ?adr a :ADR ;                   # Find all entities of type :ADR
         rdfs:label ?label .        # Get their label (name)
}
ORDER BY ?adr                       # Sort by URI

# Explanation:
# Pattern "?adr a :ADR" finds all entities of type ADR.
# "a" is shorthand for predicate rdf:type.
# In SQL: SELECT * FROM adr ORDER BY id
# In SPARQL: filtering by type is natural for the graph model.
