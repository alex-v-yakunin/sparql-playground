    ?system a :System ;             # Find all systems

ORDER BY ?systemLabel               # Sort by system label

# Explanation:
# Demonstrates relationship between entities via :ownedBy property.
# In SQL would require JOIN: 
#   SELECT * FROM systems JOIN teams ON systems.owner_id = teams.id
# In SPARQL relationships are natural - just follow the :ownedBy property.
# Property Graph: similarly natural navigation through edges.
