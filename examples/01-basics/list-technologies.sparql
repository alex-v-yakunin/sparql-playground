SELECT DISTINCT ?technology ?label  # DISTINCT excludes duplicates
WHERE {
    ?technology a :Technology ;     # Find all entities of type :Technology
                rdfs:label ?label . # Get their labels
}
ORDER BY ?label                     # Sort alphabetically

# Explanation:
# DISTINCT excludes duplicates from results.
# In SQL: SELECT DISTINCT technology FROM technologies
# In SPARQL: DISTINCT works similarly.
