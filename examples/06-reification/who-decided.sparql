# Explanation:
# This is the essence of reification: metadata about statements.
# Structure rdf:Statement describes original triple (?adr :decidesTechnology ?tech).
# Additional properties (:statedBy, :statedOn, :confidence) add context.
# Impossible in regular RDF triples without reification!
# In SQL: separate metadata table with foreign key.
# In Property Graph: properties on edges.
# In RDF: built-in support through reification.
