# RDF-star Projection from Reification
#
# Transform standard RDF reification into RDF-star format using CONSTRUCT.
#
# Expected result: RDF-star statements for decisions with full metadata

CONSTRUCT {
    << ?adr :decidesTechnology ?tech >>  # Output: RDF-star quoted triple
        :statedBy ?person ;
        :statedOn ?decisionDate ;
        :confidence ?confidence .
}
WHERE {
    ?statement a rdf:Statement ;         # Input: standard reification
               rdf:subject ?adr ;        # Subject of the statement
               rdf:predicate :decidesTechnology ; # Predicate
               rdf:object ?tech ;        # Object of the statement
               :statedBy ?person ;       # Metadata: who
               :statedOn ?decisionDate ; # Metadata: when
               :confidence ?confidence . # Metadata: confidence
}

# Explanation:
# CONSTRUCT transforms reification to RDF-star format.
# Input: rdf:Statement with 4+ triples per statement.
# Output: quoted triple << s p o >> with attached metadata.
# Use case: migrate legacy reification to RDF-star, create compact views.
# View results in "Raw Response" mode for Turtle output.
# Benefits: fewer triples, simpler queries, direct triple embedding.
