SELECT DISTINCT ?dependent
WHERE {
    ?tech ^:dependsOn+ :Linux ;        # Reverse transitive path from :Linux

ORDER BY ?dependent                    # Sort by label

# Explanation:
# Property Path ^ means "reverse direction" (from object to subject).
# ^:dependsOn+ reads as "one or more steps in reverse direction through :dependsOn".
# Searches for all technologies that have a dependency path to :Linux.
# In SQL: recursive CTE with reverse JOIN.
# In Property Graph: traversal via incoming edges.
# Critical for impact analysis: if Linux is unavailable, which technologies are affected?
