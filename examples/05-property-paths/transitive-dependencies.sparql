# Explanation:
# Property Path :dependsOn+ means "one or more steps through :dependsOn".
# Finds all technologies that Kubernetes depends on directly or indirectly.
# In SQL would require recursive CTE (WITH RECURSIVE).
# In Property Graph: depth-first/breadth-first traversal.
# SPARQL does this naturally and concisely - the power of graph databases!
